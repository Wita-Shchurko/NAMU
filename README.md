# NAMU landing page

## [ðŸ”´DEMO](https://Wita-Shchurko.github.io/NAMU/)

A landing page is implemented strictly according to the design in Figma. I used a mobile-first strategy. The site consists of a header with a dropdown menu, five information blocks, and a footer. Links in the header and menu lead to the corresponding blocks on the landing page. All buttons, images, and links have interactive effects to make the site more understandable for users. The form has validation to prevent incorrect data. Smooth scrolling helps make the site more pleasant. The speed of animations is consistent throughout the landing page.

[Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/HL3XGt5ZatvJoYBhOaWY5x/museum-prototype?node-id=323%3A1957)

It is adaptive for different screens:
  * Desktop > 992px
  * Tablet > 576px
  * Mobile > 320px

I used:
  * HTML, SCSS, JS
  * BEM
  * Flexbox, Grid
